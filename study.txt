Characters:

Geronimo:
The narrator of the musical. He is also a good friend of Julien.  

Julien Sorel： 
The central character of the musical, Julien is the nineteen-year-old son of a provincial carpenter. Ambitious, intelligent, fierce, hypocritical, and an admirer of Napoleon, Julien dreams of rising in the ranks of French society. His photographic memory gives him the opportunity to become a successful priest, but Julien wants only to be a soldier. He tries to balance the two career impulses by becoming a tutor and seducing women. Like any romantic hero, Julien falls in love with his conquests, but also never really has any idea what he is doing. What he knows of the real world comes from books, never experience. He is obsessed with becoming a modern-day Napoleon but always lets those around him choose his own path. Blind ambition leads him to forego less "glorious" opportunities and true love. His failure to succeed in both love and life is also the failure of a society that has no place for him.


Monsieur de Renal: 
Mayor of the small and beautiful town Verriere near the Doubs river. He is a conservative supporter of the Restoration and as a result, is conceited, obtuse, and greedy. He is concerned only with his title and rank, even though he is constantly manipulated and ridiculed. Julien sees him as an adversary

Madame de Renal:
The wife of Monsieur Madame de Renal. She is Julien's first love interest. She truly loves Julien and although she cheats on her husband, she is a symbol of moral purity and kindness. Unlike every other character, she is honest, compassionate, and resourceful. 

Elisa:
maid. Elisa is the first woman to fall in love with Julien.
She saw Julien having an affair with Mme in the garden. 

Monsieur Valenod:
A bourgeois liberal and thus M. de Rênal's nemesis. M. Valenod has made his fortune by running the local poorhouse, cheating the less fortunate of society out of what little money they have. He is jealous of Julien's affair with Mme. de Rênal and avenges his pride by voting for Julien's execution. 

Madame Valenod
Wife of Monsieur Valenod 

Marquis de la Mole
The benefactor of M. Pirard and Julien's employer in Paris. Marquis de la Mole is a symbol of the dying aristocracy. He treats Julien as an equal, but only when Julien wears the right clothes. He is fearful of Julien's intelligence and ambition and ennobles him reluctantly. When he found out that his daughter Mathilde got pregnant by Julien, he allowed her to marry Julien.

Mathilde de la Mole
The daughter of the Marquis, Mathilde is bored with Parisian society and immediately takes a liking to Julien. Slightly imbalanced, Mathilde has a flair for the dramatic. She is obsessed with her ancestor Boniface de la Mole and pretends that Julien looks and acts like him. She falls in love with Julien and married him. When Julien was in jail, she tried her best to avoid him from getting the death penalty.
